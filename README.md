## Synthetic Data Generation:

Used make_classification from sklearn.datasets to generate a dataset with two features for binary classification.
Visualized the dataset using seaborn scatter plots.
Data Preprocessing:

Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models:

Implemented SVM with different kernel functions (linear, rbf, sigmoid).
Trained and evaluated each model.
Performance Metrics:

Used classification_report and confusion_matrix to evaluate model performance.
